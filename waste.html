    <P>What is water pollution?</P>
    </div>
    <div class="waste2">
        Water pollution is the contamination of water bodies, usually as a result of human activities.
        Water pollution results when contaminants are introduced into the natural environment. 
        The causes of water pollution include a wide range of chemicals and pathogens as well as physical parameters. 
        Contaminants may include organic and inorganic substances. Elevated temperatures can also lead to polluted water. Water pollution is a major 
        global problem. It has been suggested that water pollution is the leading worldwide cause of death and diseases.

        <p>How we waste water</p>
    </div>
    <div class="waste4">
        How many of us who drink water from sealed bottles (pet bottle) carry with them if the water is still 
        remaining ? And how many of us throw that water in the nearby plant as we feel this water will become non-drinkable for the next day? 
        Water is not perishable after 24 hours, but it will certainly perish from the world if not well-preserved. Knowingly, not unknowingly, we waste
        water every day. We do not understand the wastage while doing small-small things as part of our daily routine.
