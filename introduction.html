    Our earth is covered with 70% of water. Water is also known as H_2O. Water manages the surface of Earth 
    and is vital to life on our planet. It is a remarkable liquid that shows atypical behavior.
    A Very Short Introduction introduces the science of water and explores how the structure of water molecules gives rise to its physical and chemical 
    properties. Considering water in all three of its states—ice, steam, and liquid—it explains the great importance of understanding its structure and 
    behaviour for fields such as chemistry, astrophysics, and earth and environmental sciences.  The role of water in biology is also described, and it concludes 
    with a discussion of the outstanding controversies concerning water, and some of the ‘magical’ properties that have been claimed for it.
    Water is a substance composed of hydrogen and oxygen and existing in gaseous, liquid, and solid states. It is one of the most plentiful and essential 
    compounds. A tasteless and odourless liquid at room temperature, it has the important ability to dissolve many other substances.
