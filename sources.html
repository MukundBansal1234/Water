            Water is constantly moving on the Earth between the atmosphere,
            ocean, rivers and streams, snowpacks and ice sheets, and underground.
          Water availability, both as surface water and groundwater,
            is essential for agriculture, human consumption, industry, and energy generation.

        <div class="availability1">
           Water availability is the quantity of water that can be used for
        human purposes without significant harm to ecosystems or other users.
        Surface waters receive water from both runoff and 
        discharges from ground water.
        Ground water, in turn, relies on water recharge from the land surface
